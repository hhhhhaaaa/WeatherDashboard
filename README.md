# Weather Dashboard
This Weather Dashboard mostly involved JS work, although there were several tweaks to the HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started
The Work Day Scheduler website is fairly simple to set up.
Step...  
1.) Download/Clone the website to your local repo.
2.) Open the HTML file in the web browser of your choice, preferably Chrome.

Due to the nature of this program, the steps to both create an account with openweathermap and retrieve an API key from said site are removed.

If you'd prefer to simply view the website, it is up on this following link!

## CSS
Created CSS to follow the requested example.

## JS
